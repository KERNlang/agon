"""Per-engine ``EngineConfig`` instances.

Add a new engine by:
1. defining its ``EngineConfig`` here,
2. adding it to ``REGISTRY``,
3. (TS side) adding a one-liner wrapper that calls ``spawnSession("<id>")``.

That's it. No new pty plumbing, no new daemon glue.

# Tools agon delegates to claude without per-call confirmation. Claude
# is running inside agon's harness — patrol rules, hooks, and the agon
# confirmation surface already gate dangerous actions at the outer
# layer. A second prompt from claude would (a) be redundant policy,
# (b) hang our pty scraper because we can't answer an interactive y/n.
#
# Using --allowedTools (claude-native, granular whitelist) instead of
# --dangerously-skip-permissions because the latter triggers a one-time
# "Bypass Permissions mode" confirmation banner that traps the pty boot
# heuristic. --allowedTools auto-approves listed tools without any banner.
#
# AskUserQuestion is deliberately NOT on the list: if claude tried to use
# it our scraper would hang waiting for a human answer. If claude does
# try it, the dispatch times out (loud failure) rather than wedging.
